    <h2>Why Dreams of Modding?</h2>
    <p>Dreams of Modding is a modding sanctuary that allows creators and contributors to come together and build, test, bug-fix, and communicate on open-source modding projects. Similar to how the site First Timers Only functions, creators can put out specific requests for assistance on various projects.</p>

    <p>From there, contributors can pick up those requests and be credited to the project for their contributions. Furthermore, users have the ability to put out mod creation requests that users may pick up and fulfill.</p>

    <p>Lastly, this community provides extensive materials, references, and tools for new and experienced modders alike.</p>

    <p>This is a personal passion project for me as I have been an avid modder for the majority of my life and I would love to create a safe community where modders can come together and create fun, innovative mods. This project is also being worked on alongside my personal mod list for The Elder Scrolls V: Skrim, Dreams of Skyrim (DOS).</p>
